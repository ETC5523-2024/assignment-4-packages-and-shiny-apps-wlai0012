Hello everyone!

I’m excited to share my first R package and Shiny app with you! 

The R package is called **CoffeeSurvey**. It includes a dataset that allows you to explore various aspects of coffee test.

You can find both the R package and the Shiny app in the **CoffeeSurvey** folder. For more information, please check the contents inside.

Here’s the URL for the package details: [CoffeeSurvey](https://etc5523-2024.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-wlai0012/)

I hope you enjoy using the package!
