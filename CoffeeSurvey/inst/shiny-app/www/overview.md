## The Coffee Test Overview


The dataset comes from a collaborative effort between James Hoffmann and Cometeer. Participants were sent coffee kits with four unique coffee samples, representing a spectrum of roast levels and processing methods:

**Coffee A**: Light-roast Kenyan coffee.

**Coffee B**: Medium-roast blend.

**Coffee C**: Dark-roast blend.

**Coffee D**: Single estate Colombian coffee with strong fermented flavors, an unusual variety.

Participants provided demographic data and feedback regarding brewing methods, coffee consumption habits, and their favorite coffee samples. The data set also includes answers about where participants usually drink coffee and how much they are willing to pay for a cup of coffee.
