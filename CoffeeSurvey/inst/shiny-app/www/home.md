## Welcome!

<br> **Coffee Taste Test Analysis** is an interactive app that allows you to explore coffee preferences across the United States using data from the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md).

Imagine you are an analyst at a research company, conducting this study to help a client develop a strategic plan for launching a new coffee shop. Your task is to uncover key trends in coffee consumption, preferences, and pricing to inform the clientâ€™s strategy.

Use the **navigation panel on the left** to dive into different sections of the survey.
